# Odin Landing Page

## About

My second repository for The Odin Project and a great opportunity to practice my design recreation skills.
Although originally I copied the template design perfectly, I made some adjustments that better suit the theme of my landing page: a travel booking agency.

## What I learned

Adding a color on top of a background image:
```css
background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)), url(...);
```
